I use React and bootswatch for the theme. Customize some bootstrap components by using CSS.
This app is done in 1 day.

If you wanted to change the api key and the location, you need to clone the repo and change the code. 
Below is the instructions.


Changing of API key:

You can see in the components folder, there's a WeatherCard.js file. In the "fetch" for fetching an api, you will change the location api(in my code it is 4217). Change it to your city zipcode. 
Then change the api key with your own api key next to the zipcode.

After you change your credentials/API key and the zipcode, run the codes by using "npm start" in you terminal to see the changes in the weather for your location.

Packages installed and framework and library used:
